		Trains are often late and you should always allow for some extra time to change trains. 
		As being late to your meeting would be fatal for the negotiations, you should rent a car instead. </message>

		<message>Long distance buses have been challenging the Deutsche Bahn for its German transportation monopoly in the last couple of years and have become a very popular way to travel, mainly because of their low prices.

		<message>Risky choice! German punctuality does not extend to the Deutsche Bahn. Did you notice that you only have 2 minutes to change trains in Kassel?
		Trains are often late and you should always allow for some extra time to change trains. 
		As being late to your meeting would be fatal for the negotiations, you should rent a car instead. </message>

		<message>Long distance buses have been challenging the Deutsche Bahn for its German transportation monopoly in the last couple of years and have become a very popular way to travel, mainly because of their low prices.

<message>The receptionist murmurs something in Chinese which you don't understand and starts to process your check in. She asks for your name again since she first thinks that your first name is your last name. In China, you state your last name before your first name. This is not an appropriate way of greeting someone.</message>

<message>This was the correct answer! By greeting the receptionist with "Ni hao" you show your conversation partner that you try to adapt the language at least a little. You also name your last name before your first name which is a common way of introducing oneself.</message>

<message> As you may know, it is common in China that all of the attendees of a meal pick by themselves what they want to eat out of all the bowls that are on the table. It is not as in a Western culture that everyone has their own plate. Chinese people prefer warm dishes and warm drinks such as tea or just boiled water. You use chopsticks and a spoon to eat. It seems impolite to eat until everything on the table is empty. In this case, Chinese people will assume that you are still hungry and will order more.</message>

<message> You are right, in China physical contact between business men is uncommon. Your colleagues will definitely feel unpleasant. By using the Chinese term for goodbye and smiling you show the most respect for your partners. Because the project manager is at a higher position and older than you are he needs to choose if he would like to thank you or say goodbye by reaching a hand.</message>

Good choice! 
 
In China it is highly important to show respect to your guest. With inviting your Chinese colleagues to an expensive restaurant you can show them that you respect them and that the work with them was worth the expensive dinner. The cheap restaurants in China might not be bad but your colleagues may think that you just were not motivated to think about a good way to show that you are thankful for their hospitality.

<message> As you may know, it is common in China that all of the attendees of a meal pick by themselves what they want to eat out of all the bowls that are on the table. It is not as in a Western culture that everyone has their own plate. Chinese people prefer warm dishes and warm drinks such as tea or just boiled water. You use chopsticks and a spoon to eat. It seems impolite to eat until everything on the table is empty. In this case, Chinese people will assume that you are still hungry and will order more.</message>

But you feel that this topic is still unpleasant for them so you decide to talk about something different. Which of the following topics might be adequate and which might not be such a good idea to talk about?</content>

<message> This is a possible way to say goodbye to someone. Even if shaking hands is not a traditional way most Chinese business men are used to this western greeting. To show more respect and your pleasure about the outcome of your visit it would have been better to express your pleasure by just smiling and tell them in a polite way that you are satisfied.</message>

<message> You are right, in China physical contact between business men is uncommon. Your colleagues will definitely feel unpleasant. By using the Chinese term for goodbye and smiling you show the most respect for your partners. Because the project manager is at a higher position and older than you are he needs to choose if he would like to thank you or say goodbye by reaching a hand.</message>

    <option href="l665e101">In comparison to the city, in rural areas it is unusual that women do the groceries. In the rural area it is a man's business. The woman

    <option href="l665e102">Because of the expensive clothes you are wearing the people are confused. "Why is a wealthy woman doing the shopping on her own?" In the Indian

	<message> 
	In India there are big social differences. The field of activity of a woman depends whether the woman´s family is wealthy or not and whether they
	live in a rural or urban part of India. Nevertheless daily chores are definitely in the field of activity of women.

		Well first it is important to know, that relationships play a big role in the career development. It does not really depend 
		on your skills but rather on your network if you will be successful or not here in Spain. Also hierarchy and positions play a big role. 
		I mean a decision will be made in the discussion with the group to give everybody the feeling that they have an influence on the decision 
		but still in the end the leader will make the decision and you better not question or criticize that. Also

		Well first it is important to know, that relationships play a big role in the career development. It does not really depend 
		on your skills but rather on your network if you will be successful or not here in Spain. Also hierarchy and positions play a big role. 
		I mean a decision will be made in the discussion with the group to give everybody the feeling that they have an influence on the decision 
		but still in the end the leader will make the decision and you better not question or criticize that. Also 
		women are quite equal to men here in the business environment.</messageBoxB>

They will probably refuse gently. When it comes to neighbors, Swedes are very conservative. They say during the first year, Swedish neighbors greet each other over the fence. During the second year, they talk about the weather and from the third year on they invite each to their home.</message>

		<message>Good decision! Because of the low power-distance Swedes have a flat hierarchy. All colleagues are usually informed or even involved in decision making. They tend to work together closely. Also, as most of the Swedish population stops working for a few weeks in midsummer to take holidays, it's good to start as soon as possible. You might be able to get a hold of a couple customers before they are gone for the summer.</message>

		<message>Reconsider your decision. Keep the flat hierarchy in mind. You should rather involve your team directly in decision making or at least keep them informed. Besides that, Swedes prefer to start working instead of “wasting time” with planning. Also, most of the Swedish population stops working for a few weeks in midsummer to take holidays. This will cause only your team to be understaffed during this period, but potential customers are also more likely to be unavailable.</message>

		<message>Despite Swedish colleagues work together very closely, they separate business and private life strictly. When you invite them to a private occasion, don’t expect them to come. They will probably refuse gently. When it comes to neighbors, Swedes are very conservative. They say during the first year, Swedish neighbors greet each other over the fence. During the second year, they talk about the weather and from the third year on they invite each to their home.</message>

		<message>Good decision! Because of the low power-distance Swedes have a flat hierarchy. All colleagues are usually informed or even involved in decision making. They tend to work together closely. Also, as most of the Swedish population stops working for a few weeks in midsummer to take holidays, it's good to start as soon as possible.

		<message>Reconsider your decision. Keep the flat hierarchy in mind. You should rather involve your team directly in decision making or at least keep them informed. Besides that, Swedes prefer to start working instead of “wasting time” with planning. Also, most of the Swedish population stops working for a few weeks in midsummer to take holidays. This will cause only your team to be understaffed during this period, but potential customers are also more likely to be unavailable.</message>

		<message>No! Behaving rude to a waiter/waitress in front of you colleague 
		can backfire very badly. 
		Even if you have booked a table you should wait to be seated. Sometimes 
		special tables 
		are booked for their location (near the window, exit…) and the waiters 
		have matched each table to the booking. 
		Another reason for the seating is to equally spread the work among the

		<messageBoxA> Thanks %prename%, let’s start. The project is set for 9 months 
		and we are starting a new online marketing strategy. With you, %prename%,
		 we are 7 team members and all are assigned full-time for this period of time.
		 Since it’s about individual marketing strategies we work both, in teams 
		 and on our own to get the most out of it. Once there’s a strategy we 
		 better test it on our customers since it’s their reaction we need to 
		 consider. Those innovative theories better get tested as soon as possible
		  before the competition will know about it. Our customers think we are 
		  the most innovative company and we want to keep it that way.

		<messageBoxA>Aang, the guy you met before, should present a quick progress of the project 
		in yesterday’s morning meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, he 
		filled in some of that time but not with those information I needed. I thought 
		that was clear enough. He said let’s find some ideas and test them straight 
		with our customers. I mean why? They don’t even want to test them first, they 
		just want the customers to know we are the most innovative company. And I 
		missed a lot of other information like who should communicate to whom? And 
		what are the company rules? I mean he didn’t even tell one of the rules. I 
		said I want to get those information but later, since the whole team doesn’t 
		need to be there for that. I just don’t get it! How am I supposed to lead 
		such team so independent and on their own without lots of rules?</messageBoxA>
		<messageBoxB href="l410e012">Same happened to me when I was abroad. You better talk to 
		Aang in private and set things straight. Tell him in specific which kind 
		of information you need to know. And don’t forget they are just setting 
		different focuses. Their focus is set on quick results and solutions 
		instead of the problems itself and who’s responsible for that. If that’s 
		not possible, please let me know, then I'll talk to the team in America. 
		Americans just do it differently; it’s nothing personal so please take 
		that in mind! Thank you for the update. This project has top priority 
		and has to work; we have a high cost pressure! Is there anything else?

		<message> Excellent. The waiters/waitresses get minimum wage. 
		Which is not nearly enough to live either on your own or to support a family. 
		The reason why the waiters/waitresses are so friendly is because they 
		rely on the tips from people. It is normal to give between 15-20%

		<messageBoxA> Thanks %prename%, let’s start. The project is set for 9 months 
		and we are starting a new online marketing strategy. With you, %prename%,
		 we are 7 team members and all are assigned full-time for this period of time.
		 Since it’s about individual marketing strategies we work both, in teams 
		 and on our own to get the most out of it. Once there’s a strategy we 
		 better test it on our customers since it’s their reaction we need to 
		 consider. Those innovative theories better get tested as soon as possible
		  before the competition will know about it. Our customers think we are 
		  the most innovative company and we want to keep it that way. 
		  Now back to you, %prename%!

		<messageBoxA>Aang, the guy you met before, should present a quick progress of the project 
		in yesterday’s morning meeting. The meeting was scheduled for 15 minutes, he 
		filled in some of that time but not with those information I needed. I thought 
		that was clear enough. He said let’s find some ideas and test them straight 
		with our customers. I mean why? They don’t even want to test them first, they 
		just want the customers to know we are the most innovative company. And I 
		missed a lot of other information like who should communicate to whom? And 
		what are the company rules? I mean he didn’t even tell one of the rules. I 
		said I want to get those information but later, since the whole team doesn’t 
		need to be there for that. I just don’t get it! How am I supposed to lead 
		such team so independent and on their own without lots of rules?</messageBoxA>
		<messageBoxB href="l460e012">Same happened to me when I was abroad. You better talk to 
		Aang in private and set things straight. Tell him in specific which kind 
		of information you need to know. And don’t forget they are just setting 
		different focuses. Their focus is set on quick results and solutions 
		instead of the problems itself and who’s responsible for that. If that’s 
		not possible, please let me know, then I'll talk to the team in America. 
		Americans just do it differently; it’s nothing personal so please take 
		that in mind! Thank you for the update. This project has top priority 
		and has to work; we have a high cost pressure! Is there anything else?

		<message>First of all the Turks don’t care that much about official rules and regulations this is also justified due to the low uncertainty avoidance rank. 
				They are more tolerant in breaking rules, that’s why it is self-evident for the taxi driver to drive faster as the limit is because no police would stop him. 
				For the taxi driver it’s fun because he is used to the chaotic way of driving so he tries to show his customer the same.</message>

		<message>Turks are smart and they like to have a confusing negotiation style. That’s why you need to be patient and flexible in terms of your timing. You should be prepared to have enough room to negotiate. Therefore, you can start with a significantly increased price including 20-40% price discount.

		<message>That would be wrong in two ways. It´s very common to talk rather by lunch and out-of-office situations about the business than in the business meetings itself. Therefore, you should apply to this rules. It´s additionally wrong to state that you don´t have the competence to answer the questions about pricing and technical details.

		<message>Turks are smart and they like to have a confusing negotiation style. That’s why you need to be patient and flexible in terms of your timing. You should be prepared to have enough room to negotiate. Therefore, you can start with a significantly increased price including 20-40% price discount.

		<message>As a former European penal colony, Australian food is heavily influenced by the British cuisine (e.g. fish and chips or meat pie). 
				In addition, the ongoing immigration of people of Asian origin leads to the situation that Chinese, Thai and Indian (e.g. butter chicken)
				food becomes more and more popular.
				Nonetheless, there are also typical Australian dishes, such as kangaroo, barramundi, the pavlova cake or the famous Tim Tam biscuits. 
				However, the koala is a protected and respected animal in Australia and not seen as a source for food.</message>

		<message>Correct! Australians favor the concept of everyone buying one „round“ or „shout“ at the bar / pub. This underlines their social 
				and generous character. However, while it is appreciated to pay for a „round“, it is uncommon to pay for all „rounds“ as this makes 
				you look superior to others.</message>

		<message>Following this behavior, you will be seen as parsimonious. Others normally expect you to pay for one „round“ or „shout“ during the evening.

		<message>Quite the contrary: In Australia it is pretty common to go out with your colleagues after work. When doing so, Australians might tend 
				to drink (a lot of) alcohol. Thus, it is not seen as problematic if you join your colleagues for a few drinks.</message>
