		<content>
			Dear %prename%,
			<br />
			I have enclosed some video links that might be useful for you. As an
			attachment you will find some information about our customer of the
			company. The company is called Concrete Machinery.
			<br />
			If you need a wrap-up about CRM in general, watch this:
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMtv6sbmdLc" target="_blank">What
				is CRM?</a>
			<br />
			If you want to learn something about competing products around
			brillianCRM, have a look here:
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6hxqg3PgRQ" target="_blank">Salesforce
				CRM</a>
			<br />
			Remember that the CRM will be mainly used by sales people. Watch the
			following video to understand a seller’s daily business:
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtJBVhkL1Eg" target="_blank">Sales
				Business</a>
			<br />
			Don’t forget that you should manage the project according to the
			standard of the Project Management Institute:
			<a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards.aspx" target="_blank">
				PMBOK standard</a>
			<br />
			Attached you can find the project charter. The project charter is
			also stored on your desktop.
			<br />
			Good Luck!
			<br />
			Kind regards,
			<br />
			Thomas

			effectively set proper goals for our team, we need to make sure that

			Dear %prename%,

			I think you should review your decision. The measures are good but
			there are some missing. I completed them for you. Please
			check them below.
			<br />
			<br />
			Use an agile project management approach such as scrum. This enables
			us to adapt them to new requirements easily and to encourage frequent
			and regular communication with the customer. Regarding time concerns,
			we should implement enough time buffers within the project schedule
			and provide a well structured project plan as well as a precise
			budget plan.

		<subject>Important! Resource and Budget Planning</subject>
		<content>
			Hello %prename%,
			<br />
			A project is a collaborative process, frequently involving research
			or design that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim. A
			well planned project saves time, money and also evaluates unexpected
			problems that may occur in the given activity. A plan is a guide that
			will help you as a project manager.
			<br />
			It will help you find the critical path. It allows you to balance
			the costs, schedule and resources to be most efficient as well as to
			set milestones and effectively track the progress.
			<br />
			<br />
			It is now the time to plan the budget for our CRM project. In the
			following activity you need to calculate the resources for every
			phase of the project. Please note the amount for each phase on a
			piece of paper in order to calculate the final amount of costs for
			the project.
			<br />
			<br />
			Good luck and kind regards,
			<br />
			Thomas

			First of all, they are still behind the schedule. But what’s worse,

			Dear %gender% %surname%,
			<br />
			<br />
			I followed up on our colleagues’ activities in India. The results are
			not what I expected.
			<br />
			<br />
			We are drastically behind the schedule. Looks like we should have
			taken a closer look into the progress of the Indian team. They are
			not even close to finish everything they had in scope for this
			section of the project.
			<br />
			<br />
			I took the time to read a little bit about the Indian culture in
			order to avoid further complications due to cultural differences.
			What I found out:
			<br />
			<br />
			In India, it is critical not to lose face in front of others. This
			may be why Avi told us that everything was going according to plan.
			It think that he was afraid of telling us the truth and losing face.
			<br />
			<br />
			My suggestion is that we talk to Ms. Oaks about how to fix this and
			from now on have a closer look on our colleagues in India.
			<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			We are not on track but very close to it. Of course hiring new

			BUT suggesting to hire additional help from Germany has proven even
			more expensive than we originally thought. We are now significantly
			exceeding our budget.
			<br />
			<br />
			I think that we need to talk to Mrs. Oaks about how to fix this.

			Hi Jessica,
			<br />
			<br />
			Hope you are doing well?
			<br />
			<br />
			I have followed up on your e-mail with our Indian colleagues. Seems
			like things are a little bit out of hand. It appears that our
			colleagues are significantly behind schedule.
			<br />
			I propose the following action to fix this problem:
			<br />
		</content>
		<option href="l317e000">Our Indian colleagues will work overtime to fix
			the problem. Obviously without additional compensation – they created
			the problem, they should fix it. 
			<br />
			This decision will have a small negative effect on quality.</option>
		<option href="l315e000">We will hire additional staff. I will follow up
			with a proposition later today. </option>
		<option href="l315e001">Maybe you, Mrs. Eberle and I can come to an
			agreement to reduce the project scope. That would enable our
			colleagues to meet the schedule. Obviously we would reduce our
			charges accordingly. </option>
		<content>
			<br />
			I am very sorry for the inconvenience created and hope we will find a
			solution that makes everyone happy.
			<br />
			<br />

			<br />
			I have followed up on your e-mail with our Indian colleagues. Seems
			like things are a little bit out of hand. As you know, our colleagues
			in India worked overtime to fix a problem with their schedule.
			Unfortunately, this measure backfired and quality has suffered:
			<br />
			* The system crashes frequently
			<br />
			* Not all required data fields have been implemented
			<br />
			<br />
			I propose the following action to fix this problem:
			<br />
		</content>
		<option href="l317e005">We have the know-how needed to deal with these
			issues in Germany. We will send over experts to solve the issue.
			<br />
			This decision will have a high negative impact on the cost, 
			but it will have small positive effects on quality and time.
		</option>
		<option href="l317e006">We will pay a bonus to our Indian employees to
			increase motivation. We will monitor them more tightly and thereby
			get things back on track. 
			<br />
			This decision will have small negative effects on cost, quality and time.
		</option>
		<option href="l317e007">We will hire new resources in India to increase
			our team’s capacity. 
			<br />
			This decision will have a negative effect on cost, but small positive 
			effects on quality and time.

		<option href="l317e008">Let’s further increase our Indian team. The

			<br />
			I have followed up on your e-mail with our Indian colleagues. Seems
			like things are slightly out of hand. Our Indian colleagues had
			problems meeting the schedule, so we sent over experts from Germany.
			We are back on schedule now, but the cost of sending our experts on
			assignment was significant.
			<br />
			<br />
			I propose the following action:
			<br />
		</content>
		<option href="l317e011">Let’s remove our German colleagues from the

			further cost increases. 
			<br />
			This decision will have a small positive effect on quality. </option>
		<option href="l317e012">Let’s send our experts back to Germany and
			decrease the Indian team size. Since we are back on schedule, Avi
			should be doing fine from now on even with a smaller team. 
			<br />
			This decision will have a positive effect on cost, but small negative 
			effects on quality and time.</option>
		<option href="l317e013">Since everything worked so well with our experts,
			let’s keep them on the project and provide further support to our
			colleagues in India. This way we can ensure the time and quality
			goals will be met. 
			<br />
			This decision will have a positive effect on cost, but negative effects

			Hello %gender% %surname% ,
			<br />
			<br />
			Thank you again for the extensive conversation last Thursday. I think
			it was good that we had this discussion and that we could clarify all
			the little issues we had. I am very positive about our progress by
			now and I feel that we are back on track with all of our tasks. I
			also talked to your assistant on Friday. I appreciate that you invested
			so much time in informing me about the situation. We should try to
			keep this close contact from now on. As I already mentioned, I am very
			satisfied with the progress of my team. We will conclude the
			implementation soon, so that we can finally roll-out the last
			components and complete the employees' training. The implementation
			has been quite satisfying so far. There are some minor bugs
			concerning the customer data. The issuing of invoices does not
			function perfectly at this point in time. In some cases the address is not generated
			correctly. Most likely it has something to do with the design of the
			underlying database. But apart from that, the implementation runs
			very well and we are about to finish soon. Let me know if you want to
			discuss the issue again. If not we will talk soon!
			<br />
			<br />
			Kind regards
			<br />
			<br />
			Avi

			PAS is on the brink to steal our best developer – Vance Veba! They
			offered him a better paid job and a prized package of PAS stocks. He
			is a very proud fellow. He has just said to me that it is not about
			the money, he likes his current job but doesn’t feels valued
			for his hard work. The only one who can change his mind is the
			project leader – YOU! Do something and hurry up, or we will lose him.

			Hello %gender% %surname%,
			<br />
			<br />
			hope everything is going well on your side.
			<br />
			<br />
			I know you have to be in the steering committee meeting in a couple
			of minutes but I’m afraid I come to you with a very urgent topic.
			There is a change in plan. The prototype development will be executed
			earlier than planned. That mean we need our new CRM database up and
			running by the end of next week.
			<br />
			<br />
			Please contact our CTO via e-mail, he has to give the green light to
			the database guys, otherwise they won’t set it up.
			<br />
			<br />
			Be quick, it’s his last day before he goes on vacation!
			<br />
			<br />
			Kind regards,

			Hello everyone!
			<br />
			<br />
			Welcome to our first steering committee meeting. I am glad that all
			of you found the time to be present today. As this is our first
			steering committee meeting I will briefly summarize the purposes and
			goals of this meeting and explain the agenda for today and the next
			meetings. All key managers of the project come together and control
			the realization of the project at the strategic level. This is where
			we verify the project’s coherence with established aims, and whether
			the project keeps established frames such as range, costs and
			deadlines. All high-level decisions for the project should be
			discussed and approved during these meetings. We will come together
			on a monthly basis and also in between if necessary. Again I am glad
			that everyone is here and that we have Avi on the phone.

		<content>Ok, then let’s go over the agenda quickly. In the following
			meetings we will start going over the minutes of the previous
			meeting, to remind us again of what has happened until then and to
			obtain everyone’s approval. As our last meeting was the kickoff
			meeting, we won’t go over the minutes today. In the following we will
			discuss the action list we composed in the last meeting. Afterwards I
			will give a status report on the project, presenting what has been
			achieved since the last meeting, announcing the upcoming tasks and
			illustrating the issues. We continue by discussing the current issues
			and decide on how to handle potential problems and how to proceed.
			After that there is time to announce and discuss any other subjects
			that you want to discuss with the steering committee. So that was the
			agenda. Are there any questions? </content>

			it... As this concerns your assistant, I didn’t want to do this over
			your head. So the two of you should sit together and talk this
			through. Mainly some feedback towards how thoroughly important pieces
			of work need to be done. Some really important requirements were
			missing and others weren’t precise enough. I fixed it MYSELF because
			we lacked the time, but that’s obviously not how I want to spend my
			time. So no consequences this time, but it's something that should be
			communicated.
			<br />
			Talk to you soon,
			<br />
			Thomas

			Hi %prename%,

			Hi Thomas,

			How was your flight back to Hamburg? Too bad we couldn’t catch up

			<br />
			B.R. reached out to me right afterwards and something came up. He
			wants us to cover analytical aspects for the CRM, too.
			<br />
			I told him that this would be beyond the current scope.
			<br />
			In my opinion, we should...
			<br />
			<br />
			...
			<br />
			The decision is of course up to you. Let me know how we should
			proceed as soon as you’ve made up your mind.

			Hi %prename%,

			I just arrived back in Hamburg just to have B.R. calling me.
			<br />
			He was really gloomy and kept telling me how much he would’ve liked
			some analytical components in the CRM.
			<br />
			I would’ve wished for you to check in with me first. Although I agree
			with you that this is out of scope, I suppose we could’ve made more
			out of that situation. There was potential business in this.
			<br />
			I know you did what you deemed best for the project, so no hard
			feelings.
			<br />
			Just make sure you finish the whole thing well.

			Hang in there,

			Hi %prename%,
			<br />
			Great job handling the change request, that’s exactly how I want
			those to be treated.
			<br />
			I totally agree with your opinion. It is a valuable business
			opportunity and we shouldn’t let it slip. Then again it’s too late in

			like the ideal solution to me.
			<br />
			As you already said - first of all, we need to secure the funding for

			will personally take care of the formalities. But bear in mind: It’ll
			still be a big change in the scope of the project, so make sure

			Hi %prename%,
			<br />
			Great job handling the change request, that’s exactly how I want
			those to be treated.
			<br />
			I will trust your advice on this. You know best how the project is
			going, after all. It is a valuable business opportunity and we
			shouldn’t let it slip.
			<br />
			As you already said - first of all, we need to secure the funding for
			this. You will have to convince Miss Eberle next week. After that I
			will personally take care of the formalities. But bear in mind: It’ll
			still be a big change in the scope of the project, so make sure
			you’re at your best.
			<br />
			Good speed,
			<br />
			Thomas

			events that happened over the last couple of weeks. As some of you
			might know, we did run into some troubles with our colleagues from
			India. Earlier in this phase of the project I asked %gender%
			%surname% to call Mr. Gupta to inquire about the current status of
			his and his colleagues work. It turned out that the programming
			progress was drastically delayed at the time which required quick
			strategic changes. %gender% %surname%, can you please explain the
			situation? </content>
		<option href="l630e001"> Thank you for the introduction, Ms. Oaks, and
			hello to all of you from my side as well. I don’t want to take too
			much of your time, so I will just say there were some problems but we
			managed to fix them. I believe that our actions are to the best of
			our interests and I would like to pass the word back to Ms. Oaks.

			do not have a life as good as those in Germany. I just remember the
			US Government shutdown a few months ago. Lots of American public
			servants didn’t get their salary paid by the government. How about
			you tell me a number and I organize this number in cash for you. Or
			maybe a watch for your husband. A new car? You know my colleagues are
			essential for this project, so you really could be part of making
			this project a big success... and you also would have a nice payoff
			from that. Right? </option>
		<option href="l666e615"> I just wanted to say that there might be

			think a small donation for your department might accelerate the
			procedure right? </option>
